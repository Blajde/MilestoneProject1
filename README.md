# The Gym Tank - Milestone Project 1
 This project was created as an examination project for Code  Institutes Full Stack Development course in HTML5, CSS3 and User Centric Design.
 
This site was created with the user purpose to find essential information about the gym, to be able to sign up and keep track
of thier workout.
 
For the gym itself it wanted to create additional channels of interaction with thier customers. The gym also wants to retain
traffic and encourage users to return to the site as well as the physical gym location.


##User Experience

First time visitors:
* To understand the goal for the gym's business
* To be attracted to join the gym and use it's services
* To find information on how this gym can help the customer get in shape
* To be able to locate and contact the gym

Returning visitors:
* To sign up for classes
* To log thier recent workouts
* To ask questions and manage thier membership

(Include links/images to mockups)

##Features

##Technologies Used

For this project, multiple technologies, libraries, languages and frameworks were used.

* HTML5	- One of the main languages to add structure to this project
* CSS3	- The other main language to add style and improve user experience
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This framework has been used to add styles and effects throughout the pages
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Provided icons and decorations to improve user experience
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - The main library for adding fonts and text-styles
* [Github](https://github.com/) - The site for hosting the website and storing the code
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - The tool in which the coding was created
* [Balsamiq Wireframes] - The tool in which the mockups and wireframes for this site were created
* [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) - Stock photos and images
* [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) - Links to external calendering service for class appointments


In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.


##Testing

During the development process the different functionalities were tested as the work progressed. The main tool to test functionality
was desktop Google Chrome with the inspect function for mobile and fullscreen testing.

At the end process additional operating systems and devices were used to monitor the responsiveness for different screen sizes

Systems used was:
* [Google Chrome]()
* [Internet Explorer]()
* [Apple IOS]()
* [Android]()
* [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) Used to validate the HTML-code markup validity.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
